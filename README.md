Prey-Predator Ecosystems (Shark-Fish-Algae)

This repository contains a NetLogo simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem, featuring sharks (predators) and fish (prey).

**Agents**

_Sharks_: Move randomly, lose energy over time, eat fish to gain energy, reproduce when energy is high, and die when energy is too low.
_Fish_: Move randomly to avoid sharks, reproduce after surviving for a set time.

**Behavior**

Sharks hunt fish to survive, while fish reproduce to maintain their population. The ecosystem models the dynamic balance between predator and prey populations.
